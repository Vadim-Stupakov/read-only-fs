1. Introduction

	AVFlt or Anti-Virus Filter is a filter for the RedirFS Framework. It is
	intended for so-called on-access scanning, which means that files are 
	checked for malicious content on-the-fly before open and after close.
	AVFlt uses in kernel cache and it makes sure than only changed files are
	checked. It comes hand in hand with the libav library which should be
	used by Anti-Virus scanners.
